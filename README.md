<strong>Project description:</strong><br>
<br>
QTCinema is media player desktop application built with PyQt5 what allows users to play video and audio files.
Application provides user interface to open media files, manage playback, switch between fullscreen and windowed modes 
and adjust volume.<br>

<strong>How to run it: </strong><br>
<br>
Make sure you are using Python 3.x version (3.13 in my case) and IDE depending on your personal preferences.<br>
<br>
Install necessary packages:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
<strong>(optional)</strong> If you want to use full functionality of the player (opening wider range of media file types), 
you will need 
additional Codec software. I've been testing the application with - <a href="https://codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_standard.htm">K-Lite Codec</a>.<br>
<br>
Lastly all that is left is to start the application:<br>
  ```
python main.py
  ```
